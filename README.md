### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

In this course we’ll take a one page design for a travel website in Figma and go through the process of converting it into HTML.

In the process we’ll learn some tricks about working with Figma, and using CSS Grid and Flexbox to make layout control a breeze.

This course is perfect for anyone who’s found a landing page design on Envato Elements and wants to code it up themselves.
